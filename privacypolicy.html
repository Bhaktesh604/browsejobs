                    <h5>Policy For Private Resume Database Hosting</h5>

                    <p>BrowseJob provides a variety of services related to hosting private databases and using certain website applications in connection with such databases. These hosted databases are hosted by BrowseJob, but BrowseJob does not own the data in them or submitted to our applications. Such databases may contain personal information about individuals, including candidates for employment and existing employees of our customers. This data may include contact details, work history, educational history, work preferences, and other data, depending on the particular customer and application. In some instances, it may include personally identifiable information ("Personal Information").</p>
                
                    <p>BrowseJob provides hosting space to customers who own these databases and utilize our applications on such data. BrowseJob conducts its activities strictly in accordance with customer instructions and pursuant to contractual arrangements with them. Customers act as data controllers with respect to all such hosted databases. The data in these databases, including any submitted to our applications, is subject to the customer's privacy policies. If you are a candidate for employment with one of our customers, refer to the customer's Terms & Conditions / Privacy Page on their career site to understand the terms and privacy practices that apply to your data. For accessing and reviewing your personal information, contact our customer with any such requests. We will cooperate with customer requests to assist with responses. BrowseJob is not responsible for its customers' privacy policies or practices.</p>
                
                    <h5>An Important Note about Your Resume</h5>
                    <p>BrowseJob gives you the option to place your resume in our database. You can control the status of your resume by setting it to private or public. Storing your resume in our database, but not allowing it to be searchable by potential employers or recruiters means you can use it to apply for a job online, but employers and recruiters will not have access to search it through our resume database product.</p>
                
                    <p>If you set your resume as private, it is not searchable by potential employers or others with access to our resume database. You may still use your resume to apply online to a job with a private resume. If you apply online to a job, your resume will be transferred to the relevant employer, who may retain a copy.</p>
                
                    <p>If you set your resume as public, but want your contact information to be confidential, your resume will be searchable by potential employers, but BrowseJob will hide your contact information and current company. You must also remove your contact information from your uploaded or copied text resume. Note that even without your contact details, it may be possible for you to be identified if you have a rare skill or job title. If concerned about being identified, do not include specific details that could identify you. If you use a confidential resume to apply to a job online, the employer to whom you send your resume will be able to view your contact information to contact you about your application.</p>
                
                    <p>Allowing your resume to be searchable without making it confidential means all parties with access to our searchable resume database (or copies thereof) will have access to your resume. Employers or other parties with access to our searchable resume database may be located in countries whose data protection legislation may not be equivalent to the laws in your country. By making your resume searchable, you expressly consent to such transfers of data.</p>
                
                    <h5>Your Rights and Privacy</h5>
                    <p>BrowseJob attempts to limit access to our searchable resume database to legitimate users such as paying employers, recruiters, hiring managers, headhunters, human resource professionals, law enforcement, and national security agencies. We cannot guarantee that other parties will not gain access to this database. We cannot control the use made of resumes by third parties who access such resumes while they are in our searchable database. You may remove your resume from our searchable database at any time; details on how to do this are given below. However, employers, recruiters, and others who have paid for access to that database, as well as parties who have otherwise gained access to the database, may have retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases. BrowseJob will take reasonable steps to ensure that parties other than those mentioned above will not, without consent, gain access to this database. However, BrowseJob is not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of resumes by any third parties. We cannot control the retention, use, or privacy of resumes or profiles that have been downloaded by third parties. Accordingly, do not put sensitive information, personality profiles, or other information you would not want made public in your resume.</p>
                
                    <h5>Security and Access Control</h5>
                    <p>BrowseJob attempts to limit access to our resume and profile database to legitimate users, but cannot guarantee that other parties will not gain access to this database. Once your resume has been disclosed, BrowseJob is not able to retrieve it from the third parties who accessed it. Accordingly, do not put sensitive information, personality profiles, or other information you would not want made public in your resume or profile.</p>
                
                    <h5>Feedback and Contact Information</h5>
                    <p>If you provide us with details of a reference, ensure that the person is aware that you have forwarded their details and has consented in writing for you to do so.</p>
                
                    <p>If you use our facilities to build a resume or post a resume in our database of job seekers' resumes, you will be providing us with personal data that we will use in accordance with this statement. Your resume must not contain sensitive data related to your racial or ethnic origin, political beliefs, philosophical or religious beliefs, membership of a trade union or political party, physical or mental health, genetic makeup, addictions, sexual life, the commission of criminal offenses or proceedings and associated penalties or fines, or any social security number or national identification number, unless you have previously sent us your written consent to process your sensitive personal data, if BrowseJob determines this to be a requirement of applicable law. If your resume does contain such data and you set your resume as public, then you agree that we may retain this information and use it in accordance with this statement. We cannot control third parties' access to such information from our searchable database.</p>
                
                    <h5>Security Measures</h5>
                    <p>You are responsible for ensuring that your log-in credentials on the BrowseJob website (your username and password) are kept confidential. BrowseJob has implemented technical and organizational measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, or disclosure. Despite these measures, the internet is an open system, and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will not defeat those measures or use your personal information for improper purposes.</p>
                
                    <h5>Cookies and Online Advertising</h5>
                    <p>BrowseJob uses cookies on the https://browsejob.site/ website to analyze trends, administer the website, track users' movements around the website, and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Cookies help personalize and maximize your use of the website, including storing user preferences, improving search results, and ad selection, and tracking user trends. You can control your cookies at the browser level, but disabling cookies may limit your use of certain features on the website or service.</p>
                
                    <h5>Changes to Privacy Statement</h5>
                    <p>If we decide to materially change the substance of this privacy statement, we will contact you via the email address you maintain in your profile. We will also post those changes through a prominent notice on the website so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and to whom we will disclose it.</p>
                
                    <h5>Legal and Contact Information</h5>

        <p>The privacy of our visitors at browsejobs.site is very important to us.</p>

        <p> As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in log files. The information in the log

        <p>Keep in mind that we may use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences when you visit

        <p> We also serve third-party advertisements on browsejobs.site to support our site. Some of these advertisers
            may
            use technologies such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will send these

            ISP,
            the browser you used to visit our site, and sometimes additional data. This is generally used for
            geo-targeting
            purposes or showing relevant ads based on your activity on our site or others. We also gather audience data
            (such as age, gender, and interests) using Google Analytics.</p>

            Privacy
            Policy as a whole shall not be deemed unlawful, void, or unenforceable, but only that portion of this
