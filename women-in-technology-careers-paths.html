                <p>The tech industry has historically been dominated by men, but this is changing. Women are

                        and maintaining software applications. With various programming languages to choose from, this
                        field offers opportunities to create everything from mobile apps to complex systems.</li>
                    <li><strong>UI/UX Designer:</strong> UI/UX designers work on the user interface and user experience
                        of websites, apps, and software. They focus on making digital products intuitive, easy to use,
                        and visually appealing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Scientist:</strong> Data scientists use advanced analytics and algorithms to
                        analyze complex data sets. They extract meaningful insights from large datasets to guide
                        decision-making for organizations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cybersecurity Analyst:</strong> Cybersecurity analysts protect organizations from cyber
                        threats by identifying vulnerabilities, monitoring networks for security breaches, and
                        implementing protocols to safeguard sensitive information.</li>
                    <li><strong>Project Manager:</strong> Tech project managers oversee projects from start to finish,
                        ensuring that goals are met within deadlines and budgets. They work closely with development

                <p><strong>Challenges Faced by Women in Tech:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Gender Bias:</strong> Women in technology often face stereotypes and biases that can
                        impact their confidence, career progression, and work environment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Work-Life Balance:</strong> Striking a balance between work commitments and personal
                        responsibilities is often a challenge for women, particularly those with families or caregiving
                        roles.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lack of Representation:</strong> A significant underrepresentation of women in
                        leadership roles in tech can make it harder for women to visualize themselves in those positions
                        or receive mentorship from others in similar roles.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pay Disparity:</strong> Women in tech can still face pay gaps, with studies showing that
                        women often earn less than their male counterparts in similar positions.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Ways to Break Into Tech:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Gain Relevant Skills:</strong> Many tech companies value skills over formal education.
                        Women looking to break into tech should focus on gaining practical experience through online
                        courses, certifications, and self-taught projects.</li>
                    <li><strong>Network with Industry Professionals:</strong> Networking is key in any industry. Join
                        online communities, attend meetups, and participate in industry events to build relationships
                        with other professionals in the field.</li>
                    <li><strong>Build a Portfolio:</strong> Having a portfolio that showcases your work and projects is
                        essential in tech. Whether you're a designer, developer, or data scientist, having a portfolio
                        can help demonstrate your capabilities to potential employers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Participate in Hackathons and Open Source Projects:</strong> Hackathons and open source
                        projects are a great way to gain hands-on experience, collaborate with others, and demonstrate
                        your skills in a practical setting.</li>
                </ul>
