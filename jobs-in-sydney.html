                    <li><strong>Networking:</strong> Sydney has a vibrant professional community, and networking plays a
                        crucial role in finding a job. Join industry-specific organizations, attend meetups, and

                        expand your professional network.</li>

                <h3><strong>Visa Options for Working in Sydney:</strong></h3>
                <p>If you are planning to work in Sydney as a foreign national, there are several visa options
                    available, depending on your situation:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Skilled Independent Visa (subclass 189):</strong> This visa allows skilled workers to
                        live and work permanently in Australia. It is a points-based system, and applicants must meet
                        the required points threshold based on factors such as age, qualifications, and work experience.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Employer Sponsored Visa (subclass 482):</strong> If you have an employer who is willing
                        to sponsor you, the Employer Sponsored Visa is an excellent option. It allows you to work for
                        your sponsor in a specific occupation for up to four years.</li>
                    <li><strong>Working Holiday Visa (subclass 417):</strong> If you're aged between 18 and 30 (or 35
                        for some countries), you can apply for the Working Holiday Visa, which allows you to work and
                        travel in Australia for up to one year. This is a great option for younger travelers looking to
                        gain some work experience in Sydney while exploring the city.</li>
                </ul>
